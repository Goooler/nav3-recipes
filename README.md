Jetpack Navigation 3 is a library for app navigation. This repository contains recipes for how to 
use its APIs to implement common navigation features.

## Recipes
These are the recipes and what they demonstrate. 


- **[Basic example](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/basic)**: Basic API usage with a persistent back stack
- **[Common navigation UI](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/commonui)**: A common navigation toolbar where each item in the toolbar navigates to a top level destination
- **[Android XR]()**: Custom navigation and layout behavior for Android XR
- **[Returning a result from a destination]()**: Return a result to a previous destination
- **[Conditional navigation]()**: Switch to a different navigation flow when a condition is met. For example, for authentication or first-time user onboarding 
- **[Deeplinks]()**: Create and handle deeplinks to specific destinations
- **[Adaptive layouts]()**: Change navigation behavior and layouts based on device configuration (e.g. window width)
